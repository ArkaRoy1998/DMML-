The task required us to cluster the documents in the "Bag of Words" data set from the UCL Machine Learning Repository that contains five text collections in the form of bags-of-words via K-means clustering for different values of K and determine an optimum value of K. As a similarity measure, we have to use the Jaccard index, that measures similarity between two documents based on the overlap of words present in both document. We have reported our results on the three smaller datasets (Enron emails, NIPS blog entries, KOS blog entries).
